**Hi,** I’m just starting on GitHub.

I am a Serb who has lived almost a half of her life here. I’ve done most of my schooling there and some here. I started my career working for two small trade magazines in the early 2000s, then I transitioned into project management in publishing several years later. I took several years off to write a novel and help my family through the crazy pandemic times... and I thought I’d share my resume [here](./resume.md).
