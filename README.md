# Hello!

I'm Tanja. 
I've done a lot of project management, mostly in the publishing industry. After going freelance for some years, working on my creative writing for a few more, I'm getting back into the project management business.

To jump start the process, I began with getting a [project management certificate from Google on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management)!

Feel free to check out any of the folowing:
